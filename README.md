# Software for Hardware Interfacing

## Course Description
This repository contains all laboratory and task submission codes required for the "Software for Hardware Interfacing" course, offered in collaboration with Value and Cairo University. The course focuses on practical applications and interfacing techniques using STM32 microcontrollers.

## Tools Required
To participate in this course, you will need the following tools:
- **STM32F401CC ARM Microcontroller**: Main hardware used for labs and tasks.
- **Proteus 8 Professional v8.12**: For simulating circuits and microcontroller activities.
- **An IDE that supports STM32**: Ensures that you can write, debug, and upload code to the hardware.
- **C Programming Language**: All code will be written in C.

## Setup and Installation
To set up your environment and run the projects locally:
1. Install an IDE that supports STM32 microcontrollers (suggestions include Keil uVision, STM32CubeIDE).
2. Install Proteus 8 Professional v8.12 for simulation purposes.
3. Configure your IDE to compile the C code for the STM32F401CC microcontroller.
4. Generate the `.hex` file from your IDE.
5. Load and run the `.hex` file in the Proteus simulation to test the project.
